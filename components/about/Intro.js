          I've loved building and playing with computers ever since I was a
          young boy. I would recycle old parts from the family computer and
          continuously take our family PC apart to repair it, clean it, or make
          improvements to it.

        <p className="dark:text-zinc-400"> 
          There was nothing more important to me than computers since a young
          age, whether it be building them, playing with them, or disassembling
          them. That's what struck my interest with hardware, not so much my
          love for software.
        </p>
        <p className="dark:text-zinc-400">
          I found my love for software only a few years ago in my adult life,
          which is what lead me to creating this portfolio, a culmination of
          learning, using new technologies like Next.js and Tailwind which is
          used here, or taking a look at CI/CD pipelines to automated processes,
          learning more about the intricacies of JavaScript and it's
          libraries/frameworks. It's a never ending learning experience.
        </p>

          Today, I'm proudly a Customer Support Engineer at Contentful with an
          extensive background in troubleshooting hardware and software. Soon,
          I'll be a Software Engineer I hope. That's where I'm headed.
